                     nored when the --kk or --qq flags are present.

              --zz     These options are used when the compiled file contains functions which are to be autoloaded. If --zz is given, the function will be autoloaded as if the KKSSHH__AAUUTTOOLLOOAADD option is _n_o_t set, even if it is set at the time the  com‐
                     piled  file is read, while if the --kk is given, the function will be loaded as if KKSSHH__AAUUTTOOLLOOAADD _i_s set.  These options also take precedence over any --kk or --zz options specified to the aauuttoollooaadd builtin. If neither of these op‐
                     tions is given, the function will be loaded as determined by the setting of the KKSSHH__AAUUTTOOLLOOAADD option at the time the compiled file is read.

                     These options may also appear as many times as necessary between the listed _n_a_m_es to specify the loading style of all following functions, up to the next --kk or --zz.

                     The created file always contains two versions of the compiled format, one for big-endian machines and one for small-endian machines.  The upshot of this is that the compiled file is machine independent and if it is read or
                     mapped, only one half of the file is actually used (and mapped).
