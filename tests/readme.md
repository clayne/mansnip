The testing system here is as follows:

test file is:
  \w+.test

To make new tests run this:

  ./tester.py (mansnip args)

Then the args get appened to the testlist.txt

To actually run the tests execute the following:

  ./tester.py (no args)

And it will run through everything inside of testlist.txt

Notes:

  You can comment out a test with # and you can have the test system stop
  by inserting a "stop" after a test on its own line.
