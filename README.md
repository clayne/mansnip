**Don't you hate** wasting time navigating through manpages with the leading pager's clunky search tools?

Ever try to find things like the "declare" built-in in `bash(1)` only to incrementally slodge through the results using the 'n' key going 'nope, nope, nope'? 

![the old way](http://i.9ol.es/animate.gif)

Even the methods of experts struggle to fix these problems.

  * `man bash `
  * `-N       ` turn line numbering on
  * `&declare ` show all the results for "declare", scan them (remember the line number for which one you want)
  * `&[enter] ` turn off the filtered view
  * `g(number)` go to that line

Stop wasting time with the 1980s ways of manually stumbling through manuals and say goodbye to these problems once and for all!

**Finally there's a better way!**

## Introducting Mansnip! 

Mansnip is a revolutionary way to navigate through manpages, a tool that no terminal should be without!

It will intelligently search through a manpage and return the results we all are looking for. 
Simply use it the way you use man, at the command line, followed by the search term(s) you are looking for.

Watch how I can immediately find `bash(1)'s` declare using mansnip without any extra effort:

Mansnip works on any manpage.

**With mansnip** you'll just zip through documentation, saving precious time you can use to write github readmes like you're trying to sell ginsu steak knives.

Watch how mansnip shows everything with a "-z" option in the 25,888 lines of the [zshall manpage](http://gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=1&topic=zshall).

But wait, there's more! You'll also get the line number and hierarchical context totally free!

*We're still not finished yet!*

You'll also get to install it easily [through pypi](https://pypi.org/project/mansnip-kristopolous/). 

Here's how do it 

`$ pip3 install mansnip-kristopolous` 

Act now, servers are standing by.
